This is a compiler that has an educational purpose. the main ideia is to explain how flex and bison integration works.

The syntax supported by this project is:i variable declaration (with attribution) and the for statement.

examples:

var a = 43;
var b = 1001.45;
var c = a + b * 5;

The motivation for this project is support students of a compiler course at Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) in Brazil. url: www.cin.ufpe.br/~if688
